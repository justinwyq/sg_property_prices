Our development concept is derived from a self-contained complete life symbolised by a full circle. Without a start or an end, it signifies “infinity”, representing the endless possibilities one can enjoy in this integrated development. Here, you see a complete life at Dairy Farm Residences made up of 3 worlds: Nature. Retail. Home.
Occupying a site area of approximately 20,000 sqm, Dairy Farm Residences is the first unique integrated development in the Dairy Farm vicinity with two levels of retail (ground floor and basement 1). There will be a gourmet supermarket, a food hall, a childcare centre, food and beverage and retail shops offering a one stop convenience at the doorstep to residents and people living within the vicinity.
Located along Petir Road and Dairy Farm Road, there is unparallel connectivity via the Bukit Timah Expressway (BKE) and Upper Bukit Timah Road. Within just a kilometer from Hillview MRT on the Downtown Line, the development is highly accessible, close to prestigious schools and retail amenities, bringing together all of life’s essentials and pleasures under one roof. Aside from a conveniently located bus stop at Petir Road, there will also be a shuttle bus service from Dairy Farm Residences to Hillview & Bukit Panjang MRT stations.
Dairy Farm Residences is conveniently connected by cycling and pedestrian networks within the Western Adventure Loop and Rail Corridor (Central) of the Park Connector Network. With its close proximity to Dairy Farm Nature Park, Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, Zhenghua Nature Park, Chestnut Nature Park and Central Catchment Nature Reserve, Dairy Farm Residences is within the heart of the city’s most forested enclave; offering a true retreat from the hustle and bustle of urban Singapore,.
Representing living in harmony at its finest in a peaceful and calm environment surrounded by floral pleasure of greenery, Dairy Farm Residences offers 460 luxurious residential homes. Arranged in two exclusive 15-storey and two 5-storey towers, Dairy Farm Residences offers a choice of spacious 2, 3 and 4 bedroom layouts with the 2 bedroom units ranging from 624 to 775 sqft; the 3 bedroom 915 to 1,313 sqft and 4 bedroom 1,335 to 1,475 sqft. To safeguard residents’ privacy, the residential towers are segregated from the commercial podium. Separate car park spaces are provisioned in the basement levels. Vehicular and pedestrian access will be from Dairy Farm Lane.
Each unit will have extending balconies that welcome the essence of nature blending seamlessly into the home. Homes on the upper floors will enjoy spectacular picturesque views of the Bukit Timah Nature Park to the west and the Central Catchment Nature Reserve and Upper Pierce Reservoir to the east.
Inspired by wood grain patterns, the recreational zones are artistically stacked into levels that form The Woods, The Canopy and The Oasis. The infinity pool will have an undisrupted panoramic view of the surrounding nature, creating a unique experience of swimming in the sky. Located underneath the pool are pockets of intimate spaces such as function rooms, spa and gymnasium, effectively articulating subtle characters of the timber and transforming it into three-dimensional and unique spaces.
As the development has a large ratio of home to communal space, Dairy Farm Residences has the aspects of resort living within nature, a modern escape into the woods. To create a sense of space where residents can feel they have entered a realm of tranquility and comfort, other facilities include a an elegantly appointed multi-purpose clubhouse, 50m lap pool, all day dining spaces, barbeque pits, tennis court, sun deck and bespoke lifestyle pavilions. By allowing the residents to interact with the woods outside and within the development, we aim to offer an immersive experience of the woods; allowing residents to feel a sense of solitude and comfort being away from the busy outside world.
Dairy Farm Residences is also a residential development with a strong environmental conscience that actively embraces a sustainable way of living. A BCA’s Green Mark Gold Plus development and adopting a green and low energy approach, 90% of the units are in north–south orientation to reduce solar heat gain; while others will enjoy stunning pool views.
