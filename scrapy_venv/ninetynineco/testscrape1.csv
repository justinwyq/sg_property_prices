The twin 36-storey blocks soar high above lush landscaping, resort facilities with plenty of water features, and vistas of the nearby reservoir and distant Bukit Timah Hill.

The unblocked orientation especially on the sky gardens surrounds residents with the whistling of wind. It’s a sensory experience akin to resort town of Whistler, venue of the 2010 Winter Olympics.

As Jurong gentrifies into Singapore’s 2nd CBD, ultra-modern commercials, mega malls, food & beverages havens and offices intricately linked new Jurong Regional and Cross Regional MRT lines.

It is close to shopping centres like Clementi Mall, JEM, Westgate, JCube and IMM. Drivers will enjoy excellent connectivity as Whistler Grand is situated near the West Coast Highway as well as the Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE). Commuters will also be happy to know that the Clementi MRT Station along the East-West line is in close proximity. From here, one can hop onto a train and get to Jurong East within minutes.

The West Coast Vale is near to the upcoming Jurong Lake District and the Jurong Central Business District. Furthermore, One-North and Buona Vista which is home to many startups and research institutions is just a short drive away to Whistler Grand.

Project Highlights:

Area full of potential with western rejuvenation

Shifting of PSA to Tuas Megaport

Jurong Region Line to be opened by 2025

Cross Region Line to be opened by 2030

Bedok is named after the Malay word ‘bedoh', a type of slit drum used for calling the common people to attend prayers at the mosque. In fact this type of drum was commonly used by the mosques as late as the 1950s. In the recent years many residential areas have grown up in this prominent Singaporean region. Bedok New Town is a recent development to this region covering an area of about 9.4 km2. It is a hilly region with a calm and quiet locale and features landscaped parks and sports complexes.
