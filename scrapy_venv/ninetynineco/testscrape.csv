Bedok is named after the Malay word ‘bedoh', a type of slit drum used for calling the common people to attend prayers at the mosque. In fact this type of drum was commonly used by the mosques as late as the 1950s. In the recent years many residential areas have grown up in this prominent Singaporean region. Bedok New Town is a recent development to this region covering an area of about 9.4 km2. It is a hilly region with a calm and quiet locale and features landscaped parks and sports complexes.

WHISTLER GRAND

DISTRICT 5 – WEST COAST

Whistler Grand, another Condominium development by arguably one of Singapore's most esteemed developer, City Development Limited. Every home by CDL is built with luxury living in mind, and Whistler Grand is without exception.

The twin 36-storey blocks soar high above lush landscaping, resort facilities with plenty of water features, and vistas of the nearby reservoir and distant Bukit Timah Hill.

The unblocked orientation especially on the sky gardens surrounds residents with the whistling of wind. It’s a sensory experience akin to resort town of Whistler, venue of the 2010 Winter Olympics.

As Jurong gentrifies into Singapore’s 2nd CBD, ultra-modern commercials, mega malls, food & beverages havens and offices intricately linked new Jurong Regional and Cross Regional MRT lines.

It is close to shopping centres like Clementi Mall, JEM, Westgate, JCube and IMM. Drivers will enjoy excellent connectivity as Whistler Grand is situated near the West Coast Highway as well as the Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE). Commuters will also be happy to know that the Clementi MRT Station along the East-West line is in close proximity. From here, one can hop onto a train and get to Jurong East within minutes.

The West Coast Vale is near to the upcoming Jurong Lake District and the Jurong Central Business District. Furthermore, One-North and Buona Vista which is home to many startups and research institutions is just a short drive away to Whistler Grand.

Project Highlights:

Area full of potential with western rejuvenation

Shifting of PSA to Tuas Megaport

Jurong Region Line to be opened by 2025

Cross Region Line to be opened by 2030

Notable schools nearby which include Nan Hua Primary School, Qi Fa Primary School, NUS High School of Maths and Science and National University of Singapore (NUS)

The luxurious land size of 442,000sqft not only gives 272 units ample of breathing and walking space, but also offers convenient services like restaurants, and shuttle bus service to this closely-knitted community. No wonder parents have no fear letting their children roam around freely in the estate.

This apartment is partially renovated. 

If you love plenty of natural lighting and breeze, this is the MUST VIEW apartment before you put up an offer. 

Note: only consider this development if you are ok with

- the balance lease of 54 years
- not being crazily near MRT. 
- climbing stairs in the apartment (about 6-7 steps to room)
- future enbloc potential 
- the wonderful strolling distance to RGS
